// =========================== ERC20 Token Contract =================

/* MyAdvancedToken.sol

   Modified from https://ethereum.org/token.

   This contract has instructional documentation.

   Within 2_deploy_migration.js we deploy and call the constructor
   with 1300 tokens for Alice.

   var aliceToken = artifacts.require("./MyAdvancedToken.sol");
   module.exports = function(deployer) {
     deployer.deploy(aliceToken, 1300, "Alice Coin","AC");
   };


   Deploy the contract with Truffle.
   truffle migrate --reset

   Run truffle console:

   truffle console


   Within the console, get access to this contract deployed on Ganache:

   var Web3 = require('web3');
   var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:7545'));
   web3.isConnected()
   MyAdvancedToken.deployed().then(function(x){ app = x; });
   app

   To use accounts on Ganache:

   accounts = web3.eth.accounts
   Alice = accounts[0];
   Bob = accounts[1];
   Charlie = accounts[2];
   Donna = accounts[3];

   etc.


   To get the address of the contract into a convenient variable.
   contract = '0x address from Ganache in quotes'

   To access the balance of account[0] - by default the output is in Wei
   web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0]).toNumber();

   To transform this into Ether, use the following:

   web3._extend.utils.fromWei(web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0]).toNumber(), 'ether')

   An optional note on debugging:

       establish an event

       event Debug(string text, uint value);

       code that works

       Debug('Note this ', uint(addr));
       return;  // You may not want to continue.
